  ### I program and design robotics systems.

  I love to work in Robotics & Mechatronics sphere. Since childhood I have loved to assemble schemes and program them to do the staff I want. I always try to do my best to find most fitable and easy-to-implement solution.

  But robotics is not only one sphere I work in. Also, I program telegram bots, do some universities and olympiad tasks, e.t.c.
