  ### I program and design robotics systems, computer vision systems.

  I received a bachelor's degree in mechatronics and robotics at Bauman Moscow State Technical University, after which I graduated a master's degree from Innopolis University, specializing in "Robotics and Computer Vision".


  I have participated in many projects related both to robotic systems control and computer vision: UAV lane tracking, UAV landing platform detection, barista manipulator, ping-pong manipulator, car wash automation, four-legged robot and so on.


  Now I am developing in the field of computer vision. In the future I see myself in this sphere exactly.


  At the moment I am working in the Autonomous Technologies Laboratory of Innopolis University as a computer vision specialist.
